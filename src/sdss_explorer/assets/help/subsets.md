### Subsets

Subsets are different _mutations_ of the `DR19` dataset that you can create, filter, visualize and download. You can create as many _Subsets_ as you like, and perform a variety of filtering options

#### Filtering

Filtering uses a combination of:
- _Expressions_: see the _Expressions_ Tab.
- _Dataset_: the stellar parameters pipeline used.
- _Targeting Filters_: specific groups of `sdss5` targets from different programs, mappers, or targeting cartons.

#### Dataset

Within SDSS-5, multiple stellar parameters pipelines are used. For a valid analysis, one must choose a specific pipeline output to use for analysis.

Note that currently, _Astra_ does not have a selection of the "best" parameters. By default, Explorer will use this in the future.

#### Downloading

Downloading functionality is currently unimplemented in this beta deployment. In future, one can download a _Subset_  by clicking the (![image](icons/mdi-download.svg)) icon.
