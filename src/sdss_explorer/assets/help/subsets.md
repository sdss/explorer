### Subsets

Subsets are different _mutations_ of the dataset that you can create, filter, visualize and download. You can create as many _Subsets_ as you like, and perform a variety of filtering options

#### Filtering

Filtering uses a combination of:
- _Expressions_: see the _Expressions_ Tab.
- _Dataset_: the stellar parameters pipeline used.
- _Targeting Filters_: specific groups of `sdss5` targets from different programs, mappers, or targeting cartons.
- _Quick Flags_: some simple flags for you to use. We default to having `purely non-flagged` data shown to you.
- _Crossmatch_: specific identifiers to filter down to.

#### Dataset

Within SDSS-5, multiple stellar parameters pipelines are used. For a valid analysis, one must choose a specific pipeline output to use for analysis.

By default, we use the `best` parameters available.

#### Downloading

You can download your subset by clicking on the button in the bottom left of the Subset card.

Note that plot selections are not included in your download outputs.
