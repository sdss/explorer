A high-speed, performant data exploration webapp for astronomy, built for SDSS-V.

## Highlights

## About

The Explorer is SDSS-V's interface for accessing and exploring Milky Way Mapper stellar parameters provided by Astra for SDSS-V targets. The Explorer is designed to provide a high-speed interface for aggregated statistics and visualizations of filtered _Subsets_ of the SDSS-V database.

Explorer is developed by SDSS-V, using `solara`, `fastapi`,`vaex`, and `plotly`. Explorer was developed and designed by Riley Thai, and is maintained by the SDSS-V Data Visualization Team.
