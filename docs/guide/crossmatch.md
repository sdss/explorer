## Crossmatching with Gaia
If you have a list of target identifiers, such as [Gaia](https://esa.gaia.int/) DR3 source identifiers you want to crossmatch with SDSS-V data, you can use the **Crossmatch** menu to find them with Explorer. Simply paste in a selection of identifiers you have (newline separated) and watch it go!

!!! info "Pro Tip!"
    Use the `Targets` View alongside crossmatching to get a good look at your data. You can compare it to our internal `catalogid`!
