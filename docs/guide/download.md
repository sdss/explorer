!!! info "Wait times"
    Making your custom file can take a while for our servers to process, depending on how much data you requested. Generally, it's available **within 5-30s**, but also depending on usage at the time, you will have your Subset ready for download!


Once it's ready, a message will pop up, and you can __click the button again__ to get your custom file!

Note that changing the subset after this will invalidate that download, and you'll have to wait for another file.
