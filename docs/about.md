# Explorer
The Explorer is SDSS-V's interface for accessing and exploring Milky Way Mapper stellar parameters provided by Astra for SDSS-V targets. The Explorer is designed to provide a high-speed interface for aggregated statistics and visualizations of filtered _Subsets_ of the SDSS-V database.


Explorer is developed by SDSS-V, using `solara`, `fastapi`,`vaex`, and `plotly`. Explorer was developed and designed by Riley Thai, and is maintained by the SDSS-V Data Visualization Team (Riley Thai, Brian Cherinka).
