# Ideas for visualization guides
There are a couple of common key things we need guides for this app, namely:

1. quick visualization server-side of some common plots and statistics
  - HR (in Gaia, SDSS, and UBVRI forms)
  - kiel
  - tinsley
  - error vs. snr
  NOTE: should these be quick access plots?
2. skyplot-esque visualizations over a variety of projections
 - l vs b and RA vs DEC plots, colored by
  - fe_h, teff_ fibre_id, logg, etc
3. comparative visualizations between different pipelines, cartons, and slices of cartons/pipelines
4. comparative visualizations between different pipelines using calculated data (VC's)
5. viewing multiple things at once

# Ideas for subset guide
This should be a no longer than 1 minute video, with a transcript, CC's, and text/pdf guide as complement (for hearing impaired or those that don't like videos).

Each small video should cover the key features, namely:
- how to use expressions
- how to use carton filters
- how to use mapper/pipeline filters (disabling best)
- how to use the quick filters (if i readd them)
- an advanced guide

TODO: this above list must be shortened, or it could all be within a single video (or 2, 1 for basics, 1 for more advanced usage?)

# Virtual column guide

Very simple 90s explanation of how to use VC's. Use a more complex, but real-world example than the snr/var_teff one i did for collaboration meeting
