## Look at the spectra of some targets

!!! note
    All references to `best` should be substituted with the new `mwmlite`.

Let's say you have a couple of Source Identifiers from [Gaia](https://esa.gaia.int/) Data Release 3 that you want to check if they were surveyed by SDSS-V.

For this, we can use the **Crossmatch** menu to find them with Explorer. Simply paste in a selection of identifiers you have (newline separated) and watch it go!

!!! info "Pro Tip!"
    Use the `Targets` View alongside crossmatching to get a good look at your data. You can compare it to our internal `catalogid`!

Now let's say we want to look at some spectra. To do this **double click on any point in the scatter plot and it'll take you to the Target page for that object**.
