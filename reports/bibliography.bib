  abstract = {The eighteenth data release ({DR}18) of the Sloan Digital Sky
              Survey ({SDSS}) is the first one for {SDSS}-V, the fifth generation
              of the survey. {SDSS}-V comprises three primary scientific programs
              or "Mappers": the Milky Way Mapper ({MWM}), the Black Hole Mapper (
              {BHM}), and the Local Volume Mapper. This data release contains
              extensive targeting information for the two multiobject
              spectroscopy programs ({MWM} and {BHM}), including input catalogs
              and selection functions for their numerous scientific objectives.
              We describe the production of the targeting databases and their
              calibration and scientifically focused components. {DR}18 also
              includes {\textasciitilde}25,000 new {SDSS} spectra and
              supplemental information for X-ray sources identified by {eROSITA}
              in its {eFEDS} field. We present updates to some of the {SDSS}
              software pipelines and preview changes anticipated for {DR}19. We
              also describe three value-added catalogs ({VACs}) based on {SDSS}-{
              IV} data that have been published since {DR}17, and one {VAC} based
              on the {SDSS}-V data in the {eFEDS} field.},

  abstract = {The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment ({
              APOGEE}), one of the programs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey {III}
              ({SDSS}-{III}), has now completed its systematic, homogeneous
              spectroscopic survey sampling all major populations of the Milky
              Way. After a three-year observing campaign on the Sloan 2.5 m
              Telescope, {APOGEE} has collected a half million high-resolution (R
              ∼ 22,500), high signal-to-noise ratio ({\textgreater}100), infrared
              (1.51-1.70 μm) spectra for 146,000 stars, with time series
              information via repeat visits to most of these stars. This paper
              describes the motivations for the survey and its overall
              design—hardware, field placement, target selection, operations—and
              gives an overview of these aspects as well as the data reduction,
              analysis, and products. An index is also given to the complement of
              technical papers that describe various critical survey components
              in detail. Finally, we discuss the achieved survey performance and
              illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data products by
              way of a number of science demonstrations, which span from time
              series analysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity
              variations from stellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics,
              metallicity, and abundance patterns across the Galaxy and as a
              function of age, to new views of the interstellar medium, the
              chemistry of star clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar
              species. As part of {SDSS}-{III} Data Release 12 and later releases
              , all of the {APOGEE} data products are publicly available.},
