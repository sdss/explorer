### How to use Explorer

Explorer is designed to help you filter the SDSS dataset down to a _Subset_ relevant to your science work. By using _Expressions_ and other filters with the _Views_ and _Virtual Calculations_, you can find relevant data for your work.

The general steps are:

1. Plot something relevant to your science, calculating any relevant data with _Virtual Calculations_
2. Use your plot results to refine your selection with the SDSS data and create new plots.
3. Clone and adjust your _Subsets_ to compare between your selections.
4. Repeat.
