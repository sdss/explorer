known bugs:
- solara's cross filter kills itself when pivot table and expression are set simultaneously.
- the application will crash if an incomplete expression is typed after the pivot table is set.
- expression editor does not return "all good" message 
- vaex cannot count catagorical data (i.e. telescope)

ALL OF THESE BUGS ARE NOT ME BUT SOLARA!!!

needed features:
- needs to exit plot without crashing app when expression that reduces minmax to invalids is entered.
