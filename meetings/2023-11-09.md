meeting:

when we drop the metadata into specutils, are we meant to be setting the keys to lowercase? Most of the other SDSS stuff uses UPPERCASE for the keys?
answer:
  - brian: generally, they keep very little in jwst loaders
  - look at jwst ones, see what metadata they keep

what order are the chips in for apVisit files? R, G, B? it seems to be correctly ordered from lowest to highest wavelength -- no rearrangement is necessary
answer:
  - it's definitely correct

andy: do we need granularity


collab: do we need a development line for local work?
  - andy: do we need a dev route for the postgresql
    - i.e. local table of empty stuff for valis hook
  - if valis can be configured for local use, then yes, this should work
  - however, the end use-case of this software is on a server -- the functionality would be purely for development

  - brain -> potentially add valis fix: only routes that use DB should fail only


collab: any other data types?

- specLite been around since DR8
  - need to ensure backward compatibility even with old gens
  - same with all other types -- 
    - likely implement as specific SDSS-V stuff
    - will need to read survey metadata to ensure we guess the4 correct version 
      - this is done PRIOR to data loading by some external thing in astropy, will need to look at this
  - for SpectrumList vs Spectrum1D cases (i.e apVisit, apStar)
    - must be able to differentiate -- done by label handler in astropy

- properties of BOSS graph
  - actual plate no, fiber, mjd (night of observation)
  - now, coadds are across multiple mjds, so we lose the keywords for file finding
  - new coadds use the same data model for storage, but without MJD it'll get confused
    - now: fake TEMPORARY catalog
  - my question which didn't get answered: is this also for APOGEE graphs

new data types:
- dailyCoadds
  - new coadds across MJD
    - mjd = day

- customCoadd
  - unknown? weird

main communication: slack, telecon, wiki, mailing list

todo:
add specLite loader
add other coadd loaders
remove all metadata things -> metadata dump to separate function.
add myself to data viz project and mailing list -> joel will do


key notes:
- loaders for continuing data types need to differentiate between labels for 5th gen and prev gens
- metadata not needed; confirm by looking at jwst loaders
- chips are correctly ordered
- communicate on Slack + Telecons + mailing lists

future:
ensure parquet will be done with airflow to ensure use during daily updates (for brian)
