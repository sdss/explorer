**Suggestions on implementations in our stack:**
- Outputting files must be done outside this application's tech stack -- essentially, the filter would be handed off to another backend (can be done as plain text even), which would then create the subset and allow the user to download it.
- I can try and implement an application-side dynamic rendering for scatter, which may take hella time, but i think it'll work
- I want to continue with this project.
- The hardest bug right now is the damn -- the rest comes down to features.
