remove 3d -- useless

investigate bqplot for scatter.


use a single plotting thing if possible: we care about complexity for end-user (tools they get used to) and end-developer (API/further dev/callbacks)

df.columns_numeric

known bugs:
- histogram plotters do not take catagorical columns along their axes, needs to be able to.
- pivot table does not update correctly occassionally when using expression editor simultaneously
- expression editor does not return "all good" message
- expression editor when emptied does not remove the cross filter (may need to develop my own expressio n editor.
- hist2D does not flip y axes when called to, just does a whole lot of nothing.

maybe change to cards


cross filter is weird
